# PasswordGenerator - Secure Password Creation Tool

## Description
PasswordGenerator is a user-friendly application designed to generate secure passwords for various user accounts. The application features a simple Qt-based GUI that allows users to customize password length and complexity, including options for including special characters, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters.

### Special Features
- **Easy to Say**: When this option is selected, the application disables the inclusion of numbers and symbols to make the passwords easier to pronounce and remember. This feature is particularly useful for creating passwords that need to be easily communicated verbally.
- **Easy to Read**: This mode excludes potentially confusing characters such as `0` (zero), `O` (uppercase o), `l` (lowercase L), and `1` (one) to avoid misreading and typing errors. It is designed to enhance the readability of passwords, especially in printed form or in environments where passwords need to be entered manually.

The application's intuitive design ensures that users of all technical levels can effectively use the tool to enhance their security practices by creating robust and complex passwords tailored to their specific needs.
